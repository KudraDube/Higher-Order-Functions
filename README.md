Higher-order functions in Python are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as their result. In Python, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions just like any other data type such as integers, strings, or lists.

Here's an example of a higher-order function in Python:

```python
def apply_operation(operation, x, y):
    return operation(x, y)

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

result1 = apply_operation(add, 5, 3)  # Passes the add function as an argument
result2 = apply_operation(subtract, 5, 3)  # Passes the subtract function as an argument

print(result1)  # Output: 8
print(result2)  # Output: 2
```

In this example, `apply_operation` is a higher-order function because it takes another function (`operation`) as an argument. Depending on the function passed to it (`add` or `subtract`), it performs the corresponding operation on the given operands (`x` and `y`).

Higher-order functions are commonly used in functional programming paradigms and can lead to more concise and expressive code, especially when dealing with tasks like mapping, filtering, and reducing collections of data. Examples of built-in higher-order functions in Python include `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.
